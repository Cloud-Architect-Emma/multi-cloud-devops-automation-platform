This project demonstrates end‑to‑end cloud architecture, infrastructure automation, multi‑pipeline orchestration, and observability — built to showcase real‑world engineering capability and architectural thinking.

# Key Features
## Multi‑Cloud Infrastructure
Deploy infrastructure to AWS, Azure, and GCP

- Modular Terraform codebase

- Terragrunt for DRY, reusable, environment‑aware orchestration

- Remote state management per cloud

- Cloud‑specific IAM/SP/SA authentication

# CI/CD Orchestration (Jenkins)
Automated pipelines triggered by GitHub webhooks

Cloud selection logic (AWS/Azure/GCP)

Multi‑stage pipelines:

- Build

- Test

- Security Scanning

- Containerization

- Deployment

- Monitoring & Rollback

# Containerization & Deployment
Dockerized application builds

- Push to cloud‑native registries (ECR, ACR, GCR)

- Deployment to:

  - EKS (AWS)

  - AKS (Azure)

  - GKE (GCP)

- Supports Helm, Kustomize, or raw manifests

# Observability (Open Source Stack)
Prometheus for metrics

- Grafana for dashboards

- OpenTelemetry for logs, metrics, and traces

- Optional: Loki & Jaeger for full OSS observability

# Security
- SAST scanning

- Dependency scanning

- IaC scanning

- Container image scanning (Trivy)

- SBOM generation
